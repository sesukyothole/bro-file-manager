# Bro File Manager Task Checklist (Prioritized)

This checklist reorganizes the existing feature list by execution priority. It starts with the smallest, easiest auth and a read-only baseline so the system works early, then expands into full NAS operations.

Status legend:
- [x] implemented in the current build
- [ ] pending

Current implementation notes:
- Read/write file manager with login gate (single admin password or local user list).
- Session cookies rotate on activity and expire after 8 hours.
- Session cookie secure flag follows request scheme (via `x-forwarded-proto`) to support HTTP in local Docker.
- Default port is 3033; Vite dev uses 5173 with API proxy.
- Symlinks are skipped to prevent escaping the root path.
- Preview is text-only and capped at 200 KB.
- Uploads use multipart form data and may buffer large files in memory.
- Archive downloads stream `.zip` by default via system `zip` (download link in Actions; `format=targz` for `.tar.gz` via `tar`); totals >= 100 MB switch to store mode (configurable via `ARCHIVE_LARGE_MB`).
- Deleted items move into a hidden `/.trash` folder; restore requires the original parent path to exist.
- Local users can be scoped to a subfolder of `FILE_ROOT` for per-share access.
- Audit events are written as JSON lines to `./audit.log` by default.
- Docker Compose writes audit logs to `./logs/audit.log` via `AUDIT_LOG_PATH`.
- `.env` is supported for configuration (Bun loads it automatically).
- `.env.example` is provided; `.env` is ignored via `.gitignore`.
- Frontend files live in the repo root (`index.html`, `src/`, `vite.config.ts`).
- Default `FILE_ROOT` in `.env` is `.`; set it to your NAS share path in production.
- Legacy single-user login uses username `admin` (or leave username blank).
- Tailwind CSS pipeline is enabled (config via `@config`, sources via `@source`, theme import for color/shadow utilities).
- From this point forward, UI work should prefer Tailwind utilities for new changes.
- Branding updated to Bro File Manager.
- Deployment docs added for Docker and PM2.
- README includes featured image (brofm.jpg).
- Changelog and versioning docs added.
- Changelog updated for icon-only reset/logout controls.
- Version bumped to 0.2.0 for zip archive release changes.
